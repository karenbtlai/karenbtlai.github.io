						<h1> PRODUCT ANALYSIS </h1>
						<h2>Human-Use Experience Analysis Report of the Breville Smart Grinder</h2>
						<p>
						Below is an eight person group product analysis report done for ergonomics class at Carleton University during the winter 2015 term. The members are Josephine Luu, Thomas Wagner, Gabriella Hong, Caitlin McCulloh, Mia Muscroft, Chi-Lan Nguyen, Samantha Astles, and myself. Our team analyzed and presented the Breville Smart Grinder's product life cycle, user cycle, anthropometrics, ergonomics, physical and digital user interface, user experience, as well as safety and manufacturing. My contribution to the team is the analysis on the digital graphical user interface.

						<h3 style="background-color:#571f46"> INDIVIDUAL ANALYSIS REPORT </h3>
						<p>
							Breville is a company known to re-innovate existing technologies by digitizing analog components. One example is their series of expensive and seemingly 'high-tech' home kitchen appliances that targets the modern, tech-savvy upper-middle class or above. These appliances' design intent is primarily style and ease of use. As Breville tends to digitize analog components for their appliances, they have the freedom to re-imagine and improve the user-cycle of their appliances for a more pleasurable user-experience. However, this difference from traditional kitchen appliances may create a slight learning curve for  some users.
							<br>
							<br>
							The Breville Smart Grinder Model BCG800XL is an example of such kitchen appliances. Priced at $269.99 CAN, it is a luxury coffee grinder targeted at coffee enthusiasts. It features a conical grinder shape, offers 25 different grind size options, and is the only grinder on the market that has an LCD screen display. The price may seem baffling for just a coffee grinder, a machine without the capability to brew a proper cup of coffee, but it is actually on the lower end of the price spectrum when compared to other home luxury coffee grinders. Some coffee grinders, such as the Mazzer, goes up to $1889.00 CAN, and it only grinds single or double dose grind size for Espressos only.
							<br>
							<br>
							Kitchen appliances priced at this range generally last and are meant to be kept long-term: the expected lifespan is 10-20 years depending on care and use. However, after the lifespan, it is difficult to dispose of, since the parts are non-recyclable. That is because, for durability, the different materials and components are fused together, and cannot be easily separated. In a sense, it does reduce waste since this product is not meant to be thrown away after a short period, but in this case, there is a trade-off between its durability and the product's recyclability. Though it can also be argued that machines with digital components are more prone to breaking than analog counterparts.
							<br>
							<br>
							To operate the grinder, simply put beans into the hopper and lock it in place. Then, select the grind size and amount according to preference, and press the start button to start the whole grinding process. The selection process on this machine is different from traditional coffee grinders. The Breville machine has digitized this process by implementing context buttons for input changes, and for the LCD display screen to display the output. Furthermore, unlike traditional coffee grinders, this machine can automatically adjust the amount of cups to the amount of coffee per cup, and vice versa. 
							<br>
							<br>
							From a marketing perspective, its sleek appearance and having an LCD display screen is this machine's main selling point. At first glance, the LCD's blue glow paired with the sleek aluminum body attracts attention. Functionally, too, it automates traditional manual operations. However, the use of an LCD display to display changes done from context buttons adds an extra layer of mental mapping and interpretation. A slight learning curve may be required to operate the machine smoothly without errors. Once past the learning curve, however, using the device becomes straightforward. Furthermore, even if errors do occur, the price of failure is only not getting the right grind. Safety mechanisms are put in place to ensure there will be no drastic consequences. 
							<br>
							<br>
							As mentioned, the primary design intent of the grinder is for style, due to marketing. This shows in the user testing of this machine: users react most emotionally to the visual sense out the five. It is a general consensus that the machine's overall appearance is "modern, sophisticated, and professional" and that it looks "expensive and reliable." However, several trade-offs had to be made for its sleek appearance. It is mostly an economical concern, since most of the cost is put into improving the appearance, while other components are neglected. While the LCD screen display is good, it is obvious the company had to keep costs to a minimum by minimizing the size of the display. Thus, the margins between separate elements displayed on the screen are too close to each other, and is hard to distinguish to which element the text on screen is referring to. Furthermore, to add to the confusion, the context buttons are a small distance away from the screen, and is hard to realize at first that the context buttons are related to the elements on the display. The context buttons also lack order priority. The start button, the most used button on this machine, is identical to others; the only distinguishing factor is a small text label. This forces the user to read each label rather than operating the user-interface more intuitively. This is a trade-off between visual appearance and functionality. The context buttons also lack feedback. The only feedback received from a successful input is the change of information on the LCD screen.  There should be flashes or colour changes on the light pipes for feedback, but this adds extra cost. The large knob on the side also lacks feedback, but that is because it manually changes the gears for the grinds, then the changes are reflected on the screen. The signal from the knob to gears is not electric, thus 4 full revolutions must be done to span the full spectrum of 25 grind sizes. The disconnect from the tactile feedback and the display may not only cause confusion, but it may also lead to excessive stress from radial and ulnar deviation in the. This feature is probably neglected as well to lower cost. The most problematic trade-off is the choice of POM gears rather than metal ones, producing the smell of burnt plastic whenever there is not enough beans and the gears grind between themselves. This destroys the user-experience. Furthermore, plastic gears are not as durable and will wear much quicker than metals. As this is a luxury product, users expect the grinder to be long lasting.
							<br>
							While this product's sleek, "high-tech" look does strike well with most, some trade-offs are made for the appearance. This product stays true to Breville's brand identity, and for this reason does market quite well towards their target market. However, some trade-offs take away from vital functionalities, and that invokes the question whether this appliance's digitization of analog components is really worth the extra cost.
