									<b>PROBLEM STATEMENT: </b>
									<br>
									Carleton University’s Parking Services needs better data toolsets to organize its fragmented data sources. One must scavenge for data, then interpret it to optimize parking infrastructure decisions to improve the campus parking experience.
									</p>

									<p>
									<b>SOLUTION: </b>
									<br>
									This proposed visualization toolkit organizes data from numerous sources. It also analyzes the data to provide smart insights useful for more informed short & long term planning.

										<h3>PHASE 1 | RESEARCH</h3>
										<br><br>
										<b>THE CARLETON PARKING ECOSYSTEM</b>
										<br>
										Stakeholders within the parking ecosystem include administration, staff, students, faculty, contractors and visitors; the parking services team works behind the scenes to improve,, maintain, and uphold parking regulations on campus.
										<span class="image main" style="margin-bottom:1em"><img src="images/timespace/stakeholder-map.jpg" style="width:70%;margin:3em auto" />
									</p>

									<p>
										Essentially, there are two opposite sides of stakeholders: business (Parking Services Team) and consumer (parking patrons).

									<hr>

									<p><h3>PHASE 2 | Synthesis & Ideation</h3>

										<br><br>
										<b>OPPORTUNITY</b>
										<br>
										Current data and toolsets available to Carleton Parking Services are lacking, fragmented, and unintuitive. A toolset that gathers all data sources into one place and presents it intuitively will greatly increase the Parking Services Team's workflow.

										<span class="image main"><img src="images/timespace/data-sources.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									</p>
									<p>
										<b>PROJECT SCOPE</b>
										<br>
										The final project deliverable will focus on the product design of the data visualization toolset.
										<br><br>

										<span class="image main" style="width:80%; margin:auto"><img src="images/timespace/project-scope.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										<br>
										Future design will include considerations for data collection point (surveillance camera) and parking patron facing platform.
									</p>
									<p>
										<b>USER VALUE</b>
										<br>
										The collection and visualization of such data can benefit the Parking Services Team in making more informed business decisions, while the parking patrons can reap the benefits of better urban planning.
										<br>
										The gathered data is applicable for both short-term and long-term decisions:
										<br><br>
										<span class="image main" style="width:50%; margin:auto"><img src="images/timespace/user-values.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									</p>
									<p>
										<b>TARGETED DEVELOPMENTS</b>
										<br>
										Urban developments fall into a spectrum between auto-oriented developments and transit-oriented developments.
										<br><br>
										It can be concluded that Carleton is closer to the transit-oriented end of the spectrum. Thus, the campus can be considered as a miniature, transit-oriented city; or more formally: a microcosm of the outer, surrounding city. This means that its nature more closely aligns with a suburb of a city, than as its own independent city.
										<span class="image main"><img src="images/timespace/types-of-developments.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									</p>
									<p>
										<b>TARGETED USERS & USER FLOW</b>
										<br>
										The minimum viable product (MVP) will be to focus on the needs of Carleton Campus as the client.

										<blockquote>
											<b>Primary Users </b> | Interact with the front-end of the toolset:
											<ul style="font-family:roboto, sans-serif">
												<li>CU Parking Services Personnel</li>
											</ul>

											<b>Secondary Users</b> | Interact with the backend of the toolset:
											<ul style="font-family:roboto, sans-serif">
												<li>Parking Services IT</li>
												<li>Parking Services Technician</li>
											</ul>
										</blockquote>

										The general flow of the product is outlined below. The touchpoints for primary and secondary users are identified.<br><br>

									</p>
									<p>
										<b>DATA OF VALUE</b>
										<br>
										<span class="image main"><img src="images/timespace/data-of-value.jpg" alt="" /></span>

										‘Pinch-points’ were identified and underwent a hypothetical problem-solution fit. From that, data  necessary to reach that solution is deduced, and compared with its data sources.

										<i>User has heard repeated reports of congestions and unsafe pedestrian crosswalks at the P7 / Campus Ave. Bridge Area. The user enters the toolset.</i>
										<br><br>
										<span class="image main" style="margin-bottom:1em"><img src="images/timespace/wireframe-2-2.jpg"/></span>
										<i>The user clicks on P7 on the map, and summarized statistics for the P7 parking lot area is shown.</i>
										<br><br>
										<span class="image main" style="margin-bottom:1em"><img src="images/timespace/wireframe-2-3.jpg"/></span>
										<i>To gather insights on the entire P7 and Bridge intersection, the user understands that he or she should create a ‘combined area layer’ to display summarized statistics for that intersection. Thus, the user selects the bridge area, and Combined Area data is shown.  </i>
									</p>

									<p>
										<b>USER TESTING</b>
										<br><br>
										<b>Premise and Intent</b><br>
										High level decision makers for different urban areas are recruited and a 45-minute interview session was conducted with each personnel. Details of their decision-making processes, chain of commands, case studies, access to data and toolsets, desired data and toolsets, etc were inquired. They are then walked through a mock scenario through wireframes (wireframes in iteration 2-1).
										<br><br>
										The intent to this study is to gather more information about the context of their decision- making process. Furthermore, this will test whether my hypothesized data visualizations are relevant and meaningful to their operations.
										<br><br>

										<span class="image main" style="width:40%; margin:auto"><img src="images/timespace/personnel-interviewed.jpg"/></span>
										<i><b>Personnel Interviewed</b><br>
Carleton Parking Services Assistant Director, McMaster Parking Operations Supervisor, Urban Planner at WSP | MMM Group</i>
									</p>

									<p>
										<b>Findings</b><br>
										It is discovered that the visualizations in the mid-fidelity mock-ups presented to the interviewees overlap with data gathered from Traffic Demand Assessments. Thus, the visualization toolset at this phase would be a tool used only once every few years, as the Parking Team assesses traffic and parking trends to update their development plan. This presents an opportunity to update the product to become a much more active tool. Should it incorporate all the data presented by my colleagues during consultation (ie. Parking payments, parking vacancies), it will become a toolset for daily use. This will drastically change the Parking Team’s user stories and habits.
										<br><br>
										There also seems to be a similarity in development plan processes between the Carleton campus and municipalities: traffic assessments and other studies are conducted every few years to update their development plans. However, as Carleton’s governing entities are much more integrated compared to cities, they have an advantage in opportunity to create more streamlined service experiences to end users. This also means that from a product development perspective, more data will be available for use at Carleton, and accessing databases for the data visualization toolset will be a smoother and less political process. It should also be noted that this similarity proves the initial premise in the concept development phase: that Carleton can be viewed as a microcosm of a city. The candidness of this product on campus will be reflected in the context of a city.

										<i>Styling options for specific data types are explored. This includes interval graphs, time filtering, and parking lot pricing</i>
										<br><br>
										<span class="image main"><img src="images/timespace/concept-dev-2.jpg"/></span>
										<i>Styling explorations for color coding, highlighting problem areas and notable interpolation; plus more data is added, and its visualization is explored</i>

										<b>HIGH FIDELITY WIREFRAMES</b>
										<br><br>
										<b>Iteration 3-1</b><br>
										<span class="image main"><img src="images/timespace/wireframe-3-1.jpg"/></span>
										<i>Visualization toolset displays default data for the overall campus during the current, Winter 2018 term. Potential problems are highlighted in red, and traffic count interpolation is highlighted in green.</i>
										<br><br>
										<span class="image main"><img src="images/timespace/wireframe-3-2.jpg"/></span>
										<i>Data for P7 Parking is displayed; problems such as high traffic and occupancy, acute winter space loss, and long waitlist is highlighted; a supply and demand chart showing suggested cost and permit quanity is shownd</i>
										<br><br>
										<span class="image main"><img src="images/timespace/wireframe-3-3.jpg"/></span>
										<i>Data for combined area is displayed; traffic congestions are displayed and overlaid on map, as well as in graph on right; note that crossing intervals are way too short, posing danger for pedestrians.</i>
									</p>
									<p>
										<b>Potential Scenario for above wireframes</b>
										<br>
										The user is investigating the P7 and Bridge area due to reported congestions and unsafe pedestrian crosswalks. He or she launches the visualization toolset to investigate.
										<br><br>
										Solutions are derived from the investigation. The data from the tool will also be used to support his or her proposal to Parking Service’s director, then VP of Finance and Administration for budgeting.

									<b>Now Available in the App Store</b>
									<br>
									After the hand-off by my team, the Seeing AI app is now available on the App Store a year later. It is amazing to be able to see a project that I've worked on being released to the public. Furthermore, it is creating a positive impact like I had hoped during the initial brainstorming stages. I am honoured to say that I am listed as an inventor on the Seeing AI patent.
