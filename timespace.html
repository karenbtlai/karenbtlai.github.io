									<b>PROBLEM STATEMENT: </b>
									<br>
									Carleton Universityâ€™s Parking Services needs better data toolsets to organize its fragmented data sources. One must scavenge for data, then interpret it to optimize parking infrastructure decisions to improve the campus parking experience.
									</p>

									<p>
									<b>SOLUTION: </b>
									<br>
									This proposed visualization toolkit organizes data from numerous sources. It also analyzes the data to provide smart insights useful for more informed short & long term planning.

									<b>PROJECT DESCRIPTION: </b>
									<br>
									The School of Industrial Design at Carleton has partnered with the campus' Parking Services Team for the 2018 honour's thesis project. A team of 6 students conducted research regarding the parking and service design experience at Carleton University. This is done through field observations, heruristic analysis, and user research.
									<br><br>
									The overarching goal is to <b>improve the parking service experience</b> for both the <b>Parking Services Team as well as the end users of the service.</b> Once gaps and opportunities within the parking ecosystem is identified as a team through mentioned research, co-design is conducted to obtain design solutions.
									</p>

										<h3>PHASE 1 | RESEARCH</h3>
										<br><br>
										<b>THE CARLETON PARKING ECOSYSTEM</b>
										<br>
										Stakeholders within the parking ecosystem include administration, staff, students, faculty, contractors and visitors; the parking services team works behind the scenes to improve, maintain, and uphold parking regulations on campus.
										<span class="image main" style="margin-bottom:1em"><img src="images/timespace/stakeholder-map.jpg" style="width:70%;margin:3em auto" />
									</p>


									<span>Essentially, there are two opposite sides of stakeholders:</span>
									<ul style="font-family:roboto, sans-serif">
										<li>Business (Parking Services Team)</li>
										<li>Consumer (parking patrons)</li>
									</ul>

									<p>
										Research findings are mapped below:

										<span class="image main" style="margin-bottom:1em"><img src="images/timespace/aeiou-patron.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									</p>
									<br>
									<p><span class="image main" style="margin-bottom:1em"><img src="images/timespace/aeiou-parking-services.jpg" alt="" /></span></p>

									<hr>

									<p>
										Current services offered by Parking Services (and its respective technologies) are mapped below. Areas of improvement are also identified.
										<span class="image main" style="margin-bottom:1em"><img src="images/timespace/problem-mapping.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										<br><br>
										Each member of the team identifies an area to focus on across the service redesign. The team continues to work together to ensure a cohesive design and deliverable across the parking service experience.
										<span class="image main" style="margin-bottom:1em"><img src="images/timespace/problem-mapping-2.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									</p>

									<hr>

									<p><h3>PHASE 2 | Synthesis & Ideation</h3>

										<br><br>
										<b>OPPORTUNITY</b>
										<br>
										Current data and toolsets available to Carleton Parking Services are lacking, fragmented, and unintuitive. A toolset that <b>gathers all data sources into one place and presents it intuitively</b> will greatly increase the Parking Services Team's workflow.

										<br><br>
										Furthermore, additional data can be collected to provide richer detail and insight for the Parking Services Team.

										<span class="image main"><img src="images/timespace/data-sources.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										<i>Current data sources include user input and Automatic License Recognition System (ALRS). It is proposed that other data sources can append to the existing, such as video processing from security cameras and image processing from satellite images. </i>
									</p>
									<p>
										<b>PROJECT SCOPE</b>
										<br>
										The final project deliverable will focus on the <b>product design of the data visualization toolset.</b>
										<br><br>

										<span class="image main" style="width:80%; margin:auto"><img src="images/timespace/project-scope.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										<br>
										Future design will include hardware / software design considerations for data collection point (surveillance camera) and the parking patron facing platform.
									</p>

									<hr>

									<p>
										<b>USER VALUE</b>
										<br>
										The collection and visualization of data can benefit the Parking Services Team in making more informed business decisions, while the parking patrons can reap the benefits of better urban planning.
										<br><br>
										It can be useful for both <b>short-term</b> and <b>long-term decisions</b>:
										<br><br>
										<span class="image main" style="width:50%; margin:auto"><img src="images/timespace/user-values.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									</p>
									<p>
										<b>TARGETED DEVELOPMENTS</b>
										<br>
										Urban developments fall into a spectrum between <b>auto-oriented developments</b> and <b>transit-oriented developments.</b>
										<br><br>
										It can be concluded that Carleton is <b>closer to the transit-oriented end of the spectrum.</b> Thus, the campus can be considered as a miniature, transit-oriented city; or more formally: a microcosm of the outer, surrounding city. This means that its nature more closely aligns with a suburb of a city, than as its own independent city.
										<span class="image main" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><img src="images/timespace/types-of-developments.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										<i>Definition of transit-oriented, transitioning, and auto-oriented developments, and the goals they may want to achieve with the help of the tool, TIMESPACE.</i>
									</p>

									<p>
										<b>TARGETED USERS & USER FLOW</b>
										<br>
										The minimum viable product (MVP) will be to focus on the <b>needs of Carleton Campus as the client.</b>

										<blockquote>
											<b>Primary Users </b> | Interact with the front-end of the toolset:
											<ul style="font-family:roboto, sans-serif">
												<li>CU Parking Services Personnel</li>
											</ul>

											<b>Secondary Users</b> | Interact with the backend of the toolset:
											<ul style="font-family:roboto, sans-serif">
												<li>Parking Services IT</li>
												<li>Parking Services Technician</li>
											</ul>
										</blockquote>

										The general flow of the product is outlined below. The touchpoints for primary and secondary users are identified.<br><br>
										<span class="image main" style="width:60%; margin:auto"><img src="images/timespace/user-flow.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									</p>

									<hr>

									<p>
										<b>DATA OF VALUE</b>
										<br>
										Useful data that can be collected from the data sources are mapped out. Furthermore, calculation of such data can present more meaningful findings for the users. These will be the data that will be displayed on the visualization toolset.
										<span class="image main" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><img src="images/timespace/data-of-value.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										<br><br>

										<b>Test Scenario with the Identified Data from Above</b>
										<br>
										â€˜Pinch-pointsâ€™ around the campus were identified and underwent a <b>hypothetical problem-solution fit.</b> From that, data necessary to reach or justify that solution is deduced. This is a typical process that a decision maker might undergo. They would obtain reports or feedback of 'pinch-points', and will need to find a potential solution to present as a proposal to the Admin of Finance.

										<span class="image main"><img src="images/timespace/reverse-deduce-1.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										<span class="image main"><img src="images/timespace/reverse-deduce-2.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										The reverse deduced data is compared with the data mapped out in 'Data of Value'. This helps confirm the usefulness of the data identified.

									<p>
										<b>USER TESTING</b>
										<br><br>
										<b>Premise and Intent</b><br>
										High level decision makers for different urban areas are recruited and a 45-minute interview session was conducted with each personnel. Details of their <b>decision-making processes, chain of commands, case studies, access to data and toolsets, desired data and toolsets, etc</b> were inquired. They are then walked through a mock scenario through wireframes (wireframes in iteration 2-1).
										<br><br>
										The intent to this study is to gather more information about the context of their decision- making process. Furthermore, this will test whether my hypothesized data visualizations are relevant and meaningful to their operations.
										<br><br>

										<b>Personnel Interviewed</b><br>
											Carleton Parking Services Assistant Director, McMaster Parking Operations Supervisor, Urban Planner at WSP | MMM Group
										<br><br>
										<span class="image main" style="width:40%; margin:auto"><img src="images/timespace/personnel-interviewed.jpg"/></span>
									</p>

									<p>
										<b>Findings</b><br>
										It is discovered that the visualizations in the mid-fidelity mock-ups presented to the interviewees <b>overlap with data gathered from Traffic Demand Assessments</b>, an assessment that is the traffic industry standard. Thus, the visualization toolset at this phase would be a tool used only once every few years, as the Parking Team assesses traffic and parking trends to update their development plan.
										<br><br>
										This presents an opportunity to update the product to <b>become a much more active tool.</b> Should it incorporate all the data presented by my colleagues during consultation (ie. Parking payments, parking vacancies), it will become a toolset for daily use. This will drastically change the Parking Teamâ€™s user stories and habits.
										<br><br>
										There also seems to be a similarity in development plan processes between the Carleton campus and municipalities: <b>traffic assessments and other studies</b> are conducted <b>every few years to update their development plans.</b> However, as Carletonâ€™s governing entities are <b>much more integrated</b> compared to cities, they have an advantage in <b>opportunity to create more streamlined service experiences to end users.</b> This also means that from a product development perspective, more data will be available for use at Carleton, and accessing databases for the data visualization toolset will be a smoother and less political process.
										<br><br>
										It should also be noted that this similarity proves the initial premise in the concept development phase: that <b>Carleton can be viewed as a microcosm of a city</b>. The candidness of this product on campus will be <b>reflected in the context of a city.</b>
